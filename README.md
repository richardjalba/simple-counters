This app demonstrates list rendering and dynamic class rendering.

The Simple Counters app lets the user control four separate counters. The user can increment, decrement, or delete the four counters.

List Rendering: The app renders a list of the same component four times.

Dynamic Class Rendering: The number display changes color when the number is 0 (grey) and more than 0 (yellow).
